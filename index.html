      <p>
        BBC Radio is an operational business division and service of the British
        Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which has operated in the United Kingdom
        under the terms of a royal charter since 1927. The service provides
        national radio stations covering the majority of musical genres, as well
        as local radio stations covering local news, affairs, and interests. It
        also oversees online audio content.

        The BBC's radio services began in 1922. The British Government licensed
        the BBC through its General Post Office, which had original control of
        the airwaves because they had been interpreted under law as an extension
        of the Post Office services. Today radio broadcasting still makes up a
        large part of the corporation's output.

        John Reith, who had been the founding managing director of the
        commercial company, became the first Director-General. He expounded firm
        principles of centralised, all-encompassing radio broadcasting,
        stressing programming standards and moral tone. These he set out in his
        1924 autobiography, Broadcast Over Britain, influencing modern ideas of
        public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom. To this day, the BBC
        aims to follow the Reithian directive to "inform, educate and
        entertain".

        Although no other broadcasting organisation was licensed in the UK until
        1973, commercial competition soon opened up from overseas. The English
        language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 as one of the
        earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to Britain and Ireland.
        With no possibility of domestic commercial broadcasting in the UK, a
        former British Royal Air Force captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935
        Conservative Party MP) named Leonard Plugge set up his own International
        Broadcasting Company in 1931. The IBC began leasing time on transmitters
        in continental Europe and then reselling it as sponsored
        English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland.
        Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that state monopolies such as
        that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the
        idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this
        purpose. It was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern
        commercial radio in the United Kingdom. The onset of World War II
        silenced all but one of the original IBC stations, with only Radio
        Luxembourg continuing its nightly transmissions to Britain.
